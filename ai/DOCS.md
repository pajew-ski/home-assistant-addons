# Home Assistant Add-on: ai add-on

## How to use

This add-on really does nothing. It is just an ai.

When started it will print the configured message or "Hello world" in the log.

It will also print "All done!" in `/share/ai_addon_output.txt` to show
simple ai of the usage of `map` in addon config.
